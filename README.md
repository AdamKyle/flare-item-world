# Flare Item World

This is a concept project, where I learn how rust works and build a simple dungeon crawler.

The idea here is players on the web for [Planes of Tlessa](https://github.com/AdamKyle/flare) can use this
to explore endless, randomly generated dungeons to increase their items in power.

## How to run in a terminal

`cargo run build`
